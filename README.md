# client-server-horoscope-app
##
This is my graduation project written in Java. It's a client-server app that gives horoscope information to the client when it chooses a date, and based on the chosen date the data for that zodiac sign is sent. Data is stored in a MySQL DataBase, I used MAMP to host it.
##
The Server can edit the data, the Client can only read it but not directly from the database, only through the server. 
The UI is made with JavaFX through the SceneBuilder.
